## Introduction
ParadigmCore is the main package that enables the functionality of the OrderStream network. Every OrderStream node in the network must be running ParadigmCore. To read more about the high-level functionality the package enables, check out the Paradigm Protocol [whitepaper,](https://paradigm.market/whitepaper) and the [WebSocket API](./docs/websocket-api.md) doc. More documentation will be published soon.

This version of ParadigmCore (`blind-star`) is the direct Tendermint implementation of the OrderStream network node software. It is an [ABCI application](https://cosmos.network/docs/sdk/core/app4.html) intended to be used with the [Tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) BFT state replication software. 

## A Note on Order Storage
The OrderStream network design follows an asynchronous event-driven architecture for order message broadcast. As such, ParadigmCore does not include a database (by default) or offer query functionality for historical orders. Instead it provides a simple interface that allows for the derivation of an order book that can then be stored in a database.

We have released one database driver so far, `ParadigmMongo`, that allows you to store all valid orders (as relayed via ParadigmCore's WS endpoint) in a MongoDB backend server running on your node, or another machine. The repository for `ParadigmMongo` can be found [here](https://github.com/paradigmfoundation/paradigmmongo). You can preview a live version of this software at https://zaidan.io/. 

Valid orders are relayed via WebSocket protocol, by default from the following endpoint (this can be proxied to public or used by any application/middleware):
```
ws://localhost:4242/
```

## Download and Install Dependencies

First, make sure you have recent versions of Node.js, NPM, and TypeScript installed.
You should then clone this repository into a clean working directory. Something like `$HOME/paradigmcore`:

`git clone https://github.com/ParadigmFoundation/ParadigmCore`

From there, `cd paradigmcore` and install dependencies: `npm i`

## Build
This version is primarily implemented in TypeScript, and should be compiled to update the JS files in `./dist`. Modify `tsconfig.json` to the correct target for your environment, then run:
```
npm run build OR tsc
```
You can just run `tsc` if the default `tsconfig.json` is used.

## Run (this section is being updated)
UPDATE: Tendermint now runs in-process with ParadigmCore, you do not need to run a separate Tendermint node anymore.

To run, you must have a tendermint node runing on the same machine on the expected port. With tendermint's binary installed, run:
```
tendermint node
```
Assuming you have already configured the node with `tendermint init`, this will listen on the ABCI port. Then, start ParadigmCore with:
```
npm run start OR node ./dist/index.js
```
## Websocket API (valid order event stream)
see [`./docs/websocket-api.md`](./docs/websocket-api.md).

## HTTP API (propose an order)
This part will be expanded on soon. The primary interface endpoint (currently is) exposed as:
```
HTTP POST: localhost:4243
```
Where `request.body` is a JSON Paradigm order. This should be the primary point of contact with `ParadigmCore` for your application to post orders. The response from the server will tell you if the order was valid and accepted, and if so, the order hash (`OrderID`) that can be used to refrence it.
