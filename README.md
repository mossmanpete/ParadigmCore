## Introduction
ParadigmCore is the main package that enables the functionality of the OrderStream network. Every OrderStream node in the network must be running ParadigmCore. To read more about what the package does, check out the [intro](./lib/docs/intro.md) doc, and the Paradigm Protocol [whitepaper](https://paradigm.market/whitepaper).

This version of ParadigmCore (`blind-star`) is the direct tendermint implementation of the OrderStream network node software. It is an [ABCI application](https://cosmos.network/docs/sdk/core/app4.html) intended to be used with the [Tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) BFT state replication software. 

This version of ParadigmCore no longer uses BigchainDB, and does not include a database or query functionality for orders. It instead provides interfaces for common database solutions that can be used at the discretion of the node's host, depending on production environment. 

We have released one database interface so far, `ParadigmMongo`, that allows you to store all valid orders (as relayed via WS) in a MongoDB backend server running on your node or another machine. The repository for `ParadigmMongo` can be found [here](https://github.com/paradigmfoundation/paradigmmongo). You can preview a live version of this software at https://zaidan.paradigm.market/.

Valid orders are relayed via WebSocket protocol, by default from the following endpoint (this can be proxied to public or used by any application/middleware):
```
ws://localhost:4242/
```

## Download and Install Dependencies

First, make sure you have recent versions of Node.js, NPM, and TypeScript installed.
You should then clone this repository into a clean working directory. Something like `$HOME/paradigmcore`:

`git clone https://github.com/ParadigmFoundation/ParadigmCore`

From there,  `cd paradigmcore` and install dependencies: `npm i`

## Build
This version is primarily implemented in TypeScript, and should be compiled to update the JS files in `./dist`. Modify `tsconfig.json` to the correct target for your environment, then run:
```
npm run build OR tsc
```
You can just run `tsc` if the default `tsconfig.json` is used.

## Run
To run, you must have a tendermint node runing on the same machine on the expected port. With tendermint's binary installed, run:
```
tendermint node
```
Assuming you have already configured the node with `tendermint init`, this will listen on the ABCI port. Then, start ParadigmCore with:
```
npm run start OR node ./dist/index.js
```

## Use
This part will be expanded on soon. The primary interface endpoint (currently is) exposed as:
```
HTTP POST: localhost:4243/post
```
Where `request.body` is a JSON Paradigm order. This should be the primary point of contact with `ParadigmCore` for your application. The response from the server will tell you if the order was valid and accepted, and if so, the order hash (`OrderID`) that can be used to refrence it.
